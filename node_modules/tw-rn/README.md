# tw-rn

#### ðŸš§ [WIP] Experimental - Not ready for production. Use at you own risk ðŸš§

tw-rn is a library that transpiles TaiwindCSS to React Native and React Native web Styles.

The difference between the current solutions is that these are already pre-compiled or harcoded. The intent of this library is to be able to use TailwindCSS and at the same time keeping the flexibility that TailwindCSS brings with the `tailwind.config.js` and also be able to declare your own classes in a .css file.
